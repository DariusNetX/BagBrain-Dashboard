# BagBrain Dashboard - Replit Project Guide

## Overview

A React.js dashboard for the BagBrain DeFi ecosystem featuring interactive UI, data visualization, and modular architecture. The dashboard allows users to track $BAG tokens, stake in the BrainBag Vault, and monitor liquidity pool statistics.

## System Architecture

- Backend: Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript
- Storage: In-memory storage (MemStorage)
- Build Tools: Vite, TSX
- UI: Tailwind CSS with custom BagBrain theming

## Key Components

**Frontend Components:**
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component with BagBrain theming
- `client/src/components/Vault.tsx` - BrainBag Vault staking interface with wallet integration
- `client/src/components/LPStats.tsx` - Liquidity Pool statistics display
- `client/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx` - Web3 wallet connection component
