# BagBrain Dashboard - Replit Project Guide

## Overview

A React.js dashboard for the BagBrain DeFi ecosystem featuring interactive UI, data visualization, and modular architecture. The dashboard allows users to track $BAG tokens, stake in the BrainBag Vault, and monitor liquidity pool statistics.

## System Architecture

Full-stack JavaScript application with React frontend and Express backend using in-memory storage.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript
- Storage: In-memory storage (MemStorage)
- Build Tools: Vite, TSX
- UI: Tailwind CSS with custom BagBrain theming

## Key Components

**Frontend Components:**
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component with BagBrain theming
- `client/src/components/Vault.tsx` - BrainBag Vault staking interface with wallet integration
- `client/src/components/LPStats.tsx` - Liquidity Pool statistics display
- `client/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx` - Web3 wallet connection component
- `client/src/hooks/useWallet.ts` - Custom hook for MetaMask wallet management
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - TanStack Query configuration
- `client/src/index.css` - Tailwind CSS with custom BagBrain dark theme

**Backend Components:**
- `server/index.ts` - Express server configuration
- `server/routes.ts` - API endpoints for vault, LP stats, and transactions
- `server/storage.ts` - In-memory storage interface and implementation

**Shared Components:**
- `shared/schema.ts` - Zod schemas and TypeScript types for data validation

## Data Flow

**Web3 Blockchain Integration:**
1. Real-time vault data from smart contract at 0xe54cde34f920f135B5a6B015e3841758E446b0D0
2. Live LP reserves from pair contract at 0x20ac738513f765036387b889595855a20634Ba51
3. MetaMask wallet integration for user authentication
4. Direct blockchain reads using ethers.js v6

**Frontend → Backend:**
1. Vault operations: User stakes/withdraws $BAG tokens via Vault component
2. API calls to `/api/transactions` create transaction records
3. Vault state reads from blockchain contract automatically
4. TanStack Query manages caching and invalidation

**Backend Data Management:**
1. In-memory storage maintains transaction history
2. Transaction API updates vault totals automatically
3. Authentic LP data from blockchain pair contract
4. CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

**Real-time Updates:**
- Live blockchain data via custom hooks
- Loading states during blockchain operations
- Error handling for failed blockchain requests

## External Dependencies

**Frontend Dependencies:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for component architecture
- TanStack Query v5 for server state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom BagBrain theme
- Vite for development server and build tooling
- Ethers.js for Web3 blockchain interactions

**Backend Dependencies:**
- Express.js for REST API server
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment:**
- Frontend: Vite dev server on port 5173
- Backend: Express server on port 3000
- Concurrent execution using concurrently package

**Production Deployment:**
- Build: `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle
- Preview: `npm run preview` serves production build locally
