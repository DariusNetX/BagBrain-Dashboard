# Replit Project Guide

## Overview

This is a newly initialized Replit project with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only a basic `.replit` configuration file, indicating this is a fresh project ready for development.

## System Architecture

The project architecture is not yet defined, as this appears to be an empty project template. The system will need to be designed and implemented based on the intended use case.

**Current State:**
- Empty project structure
- Basic Replit configuration present
- No defined technology stack yet

## Key Components

**Current Components:**
- `.replit` - Basic Replit environment configuration

**Components to be defined:**
- Frontend framework/technology
- Backend architecture
- Database layer
- API structure
- Authentication system
- Business logic modules

## Data Flow

No data flow is currently established. This will need to be designed based on the application requirements.

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies are currently configured. Dependencies will be added as the project develops based on chosen technologies and frameworks.

## Deployment Strategy

The project is configured to run on Replit's platform. Specific deployment strategies will be determined once the technology stack is chosen.

**Current Setup:**
- Replit-hosted environment
- Configuration managed through `.replit` file

## Changelog

- June 23, 2025. Initial setup

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
