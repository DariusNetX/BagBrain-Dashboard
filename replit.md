# BagBrain Dashboard - Replit Project Guide

## Overview

A React.js dashboard for the BagBrain DeFi ecosystem featuring interactive UI, data visualization, and modular architecture. The dashboard allows users to track $BAG tokens, stake in the BrainBag Vault, and monitor liquidity pool statistics.

## System Architecture

Full-stack JavaScript application with React frontend and Express backend using in-memory storage.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript
- Storage: In-memory storage (MemStorage)
- Build Tools: Vite, TSX
- UI: Tailwind CSS with custom BagBrain theming

## Key Components

**Frontend Components:**
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Main application component with BagBrain theming
- `client/src/components/Vault.tsx` - BrainBag Vault staking interface
- `client/src/components/LPStats.tsx` - Liquidity Pool statistics display
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` - TanStack Query configuration
- `client/src/index.css` - Tailwind CSS with custom BagBrain dark theme

**Backend Components:**
- `server/index.ts` - Express server configuration
- `server/routes.ts` - API endpoints for vault, LP stats, and transactions
- `server/storage.ts` - In-memory storage interface and implementation

**Shared Components:**
- `shared/schema.ts` - Zod schemas and TypeScript types for data validation

## Data Flow

**Frontend → Backend:**
1. Vault operations: User stakes/withdraws $BAG tokens via Vault component
2. API calls to `/api/transactions` create transaction records
3. Vault state automatically updates based on transaction type
4. TanStack Query manages caching and invalidation

**Backend Data Management:**
1. In-memory storage maintains vault state and LP statistics
2. Transaction API updates vault totals automatically
3. Mock LP data provides realistic $BAG/$BLAZE pool information
4. CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

**Real-time Updates:**
- React Query refetches data on user interactions
- Loading states during API operations
- Error handling for failed requests

## External Dependencies

**Frontend Dependencies:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for component architecture
- TanStack Query v5 for server state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom BagBrain theme
- Vite for development server and build tooling
- Ethers.js for Web3 blockchain interactions

**Backend Dependencies:**
- Express.js for REST API server
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
- Zod for runtime type validation
- TSX for TypeScript execution

**Development Tools:**
- Concurrently for running frontend/backend simultaneously
- Nodemon for backend hot reloading
- PostCSS and Autoprefixer for CSS processing

## Deployment Strategy

**Development Environment:**
- Frontend: Vite dev server on port 5173
- Backend: Express server on port 3000
- Concurrent execution using concurrently package

**Production Deployment:**
- Build: `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle
- Preview: `npm run preview` serves production build locally
- Replit Deployments handles automatic scaling and TLS
